Ventilation is a prevention strategy alongside [quarantine](/quarantine), test and trace, masks, and distance

# Synopsis

Just like in 1918 for the Spanish Flu pandemic, ventilation of enclosed spaces is key to reducing transmission. That can range from opening windows to deliberate air cleaning solutions which were not available in 1918.

# Carbon Dioxide Levels

Inexpensive gauges can be used to show the levels of CO2 in an enclosed space. Where there are elevated levels from exhaled breath, there is increased risk of transmission. Opening windows to lower CO2 levels is an imperfect strategy in areas of the world with pollution. Air Conditioning with adequate PM 2.5 filtering is a big part of ventilation strategies.

# Zero COVID

If your country has achieved [Zero COVID](/zeroCOVID), then changes in ventilation may not be needed in the short term. [Quarantine](/quarantine) and Test and Trace are much more important. 

If your country is aiming to get to Zero COVID and is not currently in lockdown, then ventilation is very important.

## Home heating for a while after 1918

After the "Spanish Flu" had subsided, there was a rise in home heating using radiators that lasted some decades until ducted air systems rose again.
