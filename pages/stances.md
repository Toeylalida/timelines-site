This site is in favor of "Covid-19 is predominantly an airborne disease" and against "fomites and/or large droplets are the primary transmission mechanism for the Covid-19 disease". Towards that, this site is going to treat "airborne", "aerosol" and "droplet nuclei" as the same things and be as happy to link to aerosol scientists outside medicine, as similar experts inside medicine.  This site laments that a number of scientists and policymakers claim "it is not airborne" (and similar nuanced statements; either at the outset, or still today).

This site is pro vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Any vaccine if you don't have a big choice.

This site is pro masks to defeat the pandemic, and pro #betterMasks, even if home-made

This site is pro ventilation improvements to indoor settings - particularly schools.

This site is against a bunch of other conspiracy theories: Ref [https://www.google.com/search?q=covid+19+conspiracy+theories](https://www.google.com/search?q=covid+19+conspiracy+theories)
