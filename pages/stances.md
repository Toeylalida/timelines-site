## Airborne vs Fomites/droplets

This site is in favor of "Covid-19 is predominantly an airborne disease". As part of that, we're against "fomites and/or large droplets are the primary transmission mechanism for the Covid-19 disease" as well as "you are safe if more than two meters / six feet away from an infected person". Towards that, this site is going to treat "airborne", "aerosol" and "droplet nuclei" as the same things and be as happy to link to aerosol scientists outside medicine, as similar experts inside medicine.  This site laments that a number of scientists and policymakers claim "it is not airborne" (and similar nuanced statements; either at the outset, or still today).

### Changed position: outside

With Delta variant, it is likely you are not as safe as you were OUTSIDE in the presence of an infected person. It is possible you were safe with the original strain, but you are not now. At least, statistically things appear to be worse now, but it is possible outside was never as safe as initially thought.

## Vaccines

This site is pro vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Any vaccine if you don't have a big choice.

## Masks

This site is pro masks to defeat the pandemic - even with vaccination. Also pro #betterMasks, even if home-made

## Ventilation

This site is pro ventilation improvements to indoor settings - particularly schools.

## Conspiracy theories
