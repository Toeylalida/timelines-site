To understand the fate and transfer of aerosolized nanodispersions, it is important to look at the different aerosol sizes and their physical behavior (Willeke and Baron 1993): large "sprayed" droplets, larger than about 10 to 20 mm emitted during sneezing and coughing will sediment rapidly, while smaller aerosols can remain airborne much longer.

NOTE: Back in 90s, CDC asked NIOSH to do study of whether respirator better for TB. They did, concluded that respirator needed. CDC then discounted the study.

The transmission of viruses that cause upper respiratory
infections can occur by any of the three major
mechanisms: 1) hand contact with secretions that contain
the virus, either directly from an infected person or
indirectly from environmental surfaces; 2) small-particle
aerosols lingering in the air for an extended time; or 3)
direct hit by large-particle aerosols from an infected
person. Although all these mechanisms are likely to be
involved in the spread of any respiratory virus, the primary
routes of transmission do differ between viruses. For
instance, influenza viruses are thought to be spread mainly
via small-particle aerosols,34 whereas hand contact
followed by self-inoculation with the virus into the nose or
eye has been reported as the most efficient way of
transmission for rhinoviruses.35 However, aerosol
transmission of rhinoviruses has also been clearly
documented.36

good summary

p101- coronavirus can behave as aerosol given favourable conditions

Definitions 
True long-range aerosol transmission becomes possible when the droplets of infectious material are sufficiently small to remain almost indefinitely airborne and to be transmitted over long distances. One set of infection control guidelines for healthcare settings suggested that only TB, measles (rubeola virus) and chickenpox (VZV) should be considered as ‘true’ airborne infectious diseases.89 However, it is likely that other infectious agents may also behave as ‘airborne’, given a favourable environment, e.g. whooping cough (Bordetella pertussis), influenza virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), group A streptococcus and Neisseria meningitidis. Many more organisms fall into this category, as it probably includes virtually all pathogens where replication and/or colonization occur in the respiratory tract. Table I lists organisms associated with varying degrees of aerosol transmission.90 Each organism can also be transmitted through direct contact with infected body fluids. A recent systematic review demonstrated that adequate or inadequate ventilation has an effect on the risk of infection via infectious aerosols.66 This interdisciplinary review, authored by a large group of engineers, microbiologists and epidemiologists, defined the following terms.
- Airborne transmission refers to the passage of micro-organisms from a source to a person through aerosols, resulting in infection of the person with or without consequent disease.
- Aerosols are a suspension of solid or liquid particles in a gas, with particle size from 0.001 to over 100 mm.91 Infectious aerosols contain pathogens.
- A droplet nucleus is the airborne residue of a potentially infectious (micro-organism bearing) aerosol from which most of the liquid has evaporated.92
On the basis of these definitions, the following clinically applicable distinctions are made between short-range airborne infection routes (between individuals, generally less than 1-m apart) and long-range routes (within a room, between rooms or between distant locations, generally greater than 1-m distances): e The short-range airborne infection route depends on the close proximity of the infected source and susceptible host. A study was performed recently (Xie et al., unpublished observations) to define more clearly the size of the droplets originally referred to by Wells.92 These terms are also in common current use. This study proposes the following size definitions: ‘large-droplet’ diameter >60 mm, ‘small droplet’ diameter <60 mm and ‘droplet nuclei’ diameter
[p103]
Exhaled air from both nose and mouth is able to enter and mix with air in the breathing zone of another person standing nearby (e.g. patients and doctors on a ward round at the bedside). Thus, short-range transmission implies that air flows between individuals may interact to infect one another.94 In addition, it has been shown that the use of a simple oxygen mask may also generate a short-range (<1m) infectious aerosol, with a potential risk to nearby healthcare workers and other patients.72,73 Together with nebulizers, oxygen masks fall into this classification of potential short-range aerosol transmission sources, but some droplets generated by such masks can evaporate to become droplet nuclei that can also transmit infection over larger distances.57 e Long-range aerosol transmission refers to the potential for agents to be carried long distances by air flows to cause infection, and includes the traditional terms ‘small-droplet’ or ‘droplet nuclei’ and ‘airborne’. Virtually all infectious agents that can cause infection at long range can also cause infection at short range as well as by direct contact. Therefore, use of the term ‘long range’ refers to the greatest distance from their source at which these agents have the potential to cause infection.

Infectious agents transmissible by aerosols

If the pathogen has some part of its life cycle in the respiratory tract, it is more likely to be present in aerosols generated and projected into the surrounding air by breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing and singing. For truly airborne pathogens (TB, measles and VZV), the routes of acquisition and dissemination of the infectious particles are well recognized to be via the respiratory tract. In the other pathogens listed in Table I, acquisition of the infection is also via the respiratory tract, which is the primary site of infection and replication. Therefore, these other pathogens, such as parvovirus B19, enteroviruses and the organisms of atypical pneumonias [M. pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci (previously Chlamydia psittaci), Chlamydophila pneumoniae (previously Chlamydia pneumoniae), Coxiella burnetti and Legionella pneumophila], have the potential to be transmitted via aerosols as their life cycle involves replication at some point in the respiratory tract. Regarding L. pneumophila, replication also occurs in water systems, and human infection can occur via infected water aerosols, such as showerheads and fountains. With SARS-CoV, viral RNA as well as viable (culturable) virus has been found in air samples.95,96 Therefore, SARS-CoV can potentially be transmitted by short- and long-range aerosols to cause disease, as has been strongly implicated by several studies.1e5

In the downward flow system, because of the short settling time frame, turbulence was the only significant driving mechanism, and lateral dispersion was limited to short distances (<0.31 m from the center). In the ceiling-return system, where both bulk flow transport and turbulent dispersion were effective, small aerosols were dispersed laterally throughout the entire width of the room (2.4 m from the center).

I.B.3.d. Emerging Issues Concerning Airborne Transmission of Infectious Agents
I.B.3.d.i. Transmission From Patients

The emergence of SARS in 2002, the importation of monkeypox into the United States in 2003, and the emergence of avian influenza present challenges to the assignment of isolation categories due to conflicting information and uncertainty about possible routes of transmission. Although SARS-CoV is transmitted primarily by contact and/or droplet routes, airborne transmission over a limited distance (eg, within a room) has been suggested, although not proven.134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141 This is true of other infectious agents as well, such as influenza virus130 and noroviruses.132, 142, 143 Influenza viruses are transmitted primarily by close contact with respiratory droplets,23, 102 and acquisition by HCWs has been prevented by Droplet Precautions, even when positive-pressure rooms were used in one center.144 However, inhalational transmission could not be excluded in an outbreak of influenza in the passengers and crew of an aircraft.130 Observations of a protective effect of ultraviolet light in preventing influenza among patients with tuberculosis during the influenza pandemic of 1957–1958 have been used to suggest airborne transmission.145, 146

In contrast to the strict interpretation of an airborne route for transmission (ie, long distances beyond the patient room environment), short-distance transmission by small-particle aerosols generated under specific circumstances (eg, during endotracheal intubation) to persons in the immediate area near the patient also has been demonstrated. Aerosolized particles < 100 μm in diameter can remain suspended in air when room air current velocities exceed the terminal settling velocities of the particles.109 SARS-CoV transmission has been associated with endotracheal intubation, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.93, 94, 96, 98, 141 Although the most frequent routes of transmission of noroviruses are contact and foodborne and waterborne routes, several reports suggest that noroviruses also may be transmitted through aerosolization of infectious particles from vomitus or fecal material.142, 143, 147, 148 It is hypothesized that the aerosolized particles are inhaled and subsequently swallowed.

Roy and Milton have proposed a new classification for aerosol transmission when evaluating routes of SARS transmission:

• Obligate. Under natural conditions, disease occurs after transmission of the agent only through inhalation of small-particle aerosols (eg, tuberculosis).
• Preferential. Natural infection results from transmission through multiple routes, but small-particle aerosols are the predominant route (eg, measles, varicella).
• Opportunistic. Under special circumstances, agents that naturally cause disease through other routes may be transmitted through small-particle aerosols.149

This conceptual framework can explain rare occurrences of airborne transmission of agents that are transmitted most frequently by other routes (eg, smallpox, SARS, influenza, noroviruses). Concerns about unknown or possible routes of transmission of agents associated with severe disease and no known treatment often result in the adoption of overextreme prevention strategies, and recommended precautions may change as the epidemiology of an emerging infection becomes more well defined and controversial issues are resolved.

The main motivation for this work comes from great concern about airborne transmission of avian and 2009 H1N1 inﬂuenza to the health care community. Bio-aerosols such as sputum droplets [24] have been referredto asan important modeof transmissionof inﬂuenzabymanyresearchers[3,6,7,11,17,21e23,38e40,48,55].The virus-laden bio-aerosols can originate from respiratory activities suchascoughing,sneezing,andspeakingfrominfectedindividuals. It is important to note that dried nuclei of aerosols may remain suspended in air and be transported with the airﬂow due to airconditioning or other negative pressure-ventilation systems. In recentyears,emphasisonandimprovementofphysicalandclinical processes have helped to limit the spread of airborne transmission of diseases. However, there is notalways consensus among experts on the range over which particles are transported and the size of droplets that are truly airborne in the engineering context.

Furthermore, how the composition of the droplet affects its transmission is not well understood. The transport properties of aerosols are strongly dependent on droplet diameter. Particles with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 microns (Da < 10 mm) remain suspended for a sufﬁcient time to permit dispersion throughout the room [55]. Larger droplets (Da > 10 mm) are removed from the air more rapidly by gravitational settling. For aqueous droplets, the evaporation process affects the drifting velocity of the droplets and the concentration of solutes within the droplets [15]. Numerical simulations have shown that the evaporation of 50 mm droplets occurred in several seconds as their diameter was reduced to less than 5 mm under the condition of 0.6 or 60% relative humidity [9,46]. Recent experimental measurements have shown that the geometrical mean diameter of droplets was about 13.5 mm for coughing and 16.0 mm for speaking.The estimated total number of droplets expelled was in the range of 947e2085 per cough [11]. Laboratory experiments have shown that 90% of large size (Da > 50 mm) water droplets rapidly settled at a distance of 1e2m from the point of emission. Only about 4e10% of droplets remain suspended in room air (Da < 10 mm), and the evaporation time of

When working with hazardous chemicals and biological agents, touching and ingestion must be prevented. This is well covered by COVID-19 recommendations to wash hands. In addition, processes that can – even accidentally – spray and aerosolize the nanodispersion need to be checked in detail. An efficient risk management addresses the risk at the source, during transmission in the air, and at the target (WHO 2012).

aerosol inside air discussion

Aerosols	
Particles released into the air from a liquid or solid matrix	
How long such particles remain suspended depends on the combined influence of the nature of the matrix, air turbulence, light, air temperature, and relative humidity.

Airborne spread	
Spread of infections via inhalation of an infectious agent	
Such spread requires that respirable particles carrying infectious agents remain suspended in air long enough to be inhaled by a potential host.

Droplet nuclei	
Airborne particles derived from larger droplets after loss of water	
Such droplets are crucial for the spread of infectious agents by air as their relatively small size (0.5-5.0 µm) allows for their stability in air while also permitting their retention on inhalation.

 



As shown in Figure 3, particles >10 µm in diameter entering the air may rapidly fall out of the air because of their mass under prevailing environmental conditions, particularly temperature and relative humidity, whereas smaller particles can not only remain airborne for extended periods but can also be transported readily indoors by air currents over considerable distances. Respirable particles fall in the range of 0.2-5.0 µm in diameter, whereas smaller particles are generally exhaled because of the aerodynamics of breathing. The actual site of retention of the inhaled particles depends on their nominal size. It is noteworthy here that persons with respiratory infections breathe out pathogen-laden particles during tidal breathing.11

A human adult at rest breathes in an average of 11,000 L of air per day.12 In any given setting, one may choose not to drink the water or eat the food that is available but generally has little choice in breathing the same air as everyone else. This makes air an environmental equalizer—conferring on it the unique potential to parse out evenly whatever it may contain. Further, infectious agents entering indoor air mix rapidly with no perceptible color or smell.

Although the potential of air to spread respiratory pathogens is well recognized, its ability to transmit enteric pathogens is not as well appreciated. Airborne particles containing enteric pathogens may be retained in the tonsillar region and swallowed for relocation to the gastrointestinal tract with subsequent replication there.13 Ijaz et al14 have provided a comprehensive list of human pathogens known or suspected to spread via indoor air.

Humans that have respiratory symptoms typically "spray" (a directional high-speed release process) large droplets of "nanodispersions" (the liquid present in the nose and upper airways) also known as sneezing and coughing. In addition, humans always, whether sick or not, release a cloud of much smaller aerosols during breathing, speaking, talking, singing, chanting loudly or coughing (in increasing order) (Johnson and Morawska 2009; Asadi et al. 2019), which corresponds to a fogging process. This "personal cloud" consist of micro-droplets of lung lining liquid that becomes airborne when the terminal bronchioles re-open during inhalation (Johnson and Morawska 2009). 
In both processes, the nanoparticles dispersed in the lining fluid are included in the droplets, which is known from studies of nanoparticle exposed individuals (Sauvain et al. 2014). The nanoparticle source strength (how much is released per time unit) corresponds to the cumulative volume of liquid that got airborne.

1.1.1.7.10.	2016 - Review of Coronas
Determining which route is most important is challenging, but it seems that direct contact, indirect contact, droplet and airborne transmission do occur with both SARS-CoV and influenza viruses on occasion.8,68  Few data are available evaluating transmission routes for coronaviruses, but the relative importance of the various routes for influenza virus has been evaluated through mathematical models, animal models, and intervention studies.9,93,94

- not reliable
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1473309907700294

Despite 70 years of research since the influenza virus A was discovered,5  there continues to be vocal debate about the modes of influenza transmission, specifically whether influenza is transmitted via the airborne route, via the droplet or contact route, or a combination of these routes. Establishing how influenza is transmitted under different circumstances, and whether transmission requires close contact, is of great importance because the results will have a major influence on the choice of infection control measures in health-care settings.

Airborne precautions involve special ventilation controls, and to a lesser extent specialised masks (respirators), to prevent transmission. According to standard definitions, close contact is not required for airborne transmission to occur.6,7 Necessitating the use of airborne precautions during a pandemic would require extraordinary resources and substantial advance planning; acknowledgment of a significant contribution of airborne transmission will affect where patients should be treated, how they would be triaged, the use of antiviral agents, and the choice of personal protective equipment.
However, preventing droplet and contact transmission would require quite different control measures, since close contact with an infected case would typically be required for transmission to occur

...

A quasiexperimental study compared a cohort of college students with documented influenza A infection acquired naturally during three outbreaks, with healthy volunteers who had been intranasally inoculated with wild type influenza A viruses.30 The experimentally infected group had milder illness and shorter duration of cough. 
Additionally, those with naturally acquired illness showed more abnormalities in small airway function and increased airway reactivity than those with experimentally induced illness. The investigators suggest that this provides evidence that the pathogenesis of natural influenza A infection involves the deposition of aerosolised virus particles distal to the nasal passages.30


Several mathematical models have been applied to SARS transmission, but none has considered an environmental route.93,95 However, some influenza transmission models have evaluated the relative importance of airborne, droplet, and contact influenza transmission.9,96,97 Two of these models conclude that contact transmission of influenza is at least as important as airborne or droplet spread, whereas one study found that contact transmission was negligible compared with
other routes.9,96,97 However, it is important to note that the relative contribution of contact, droplet, and airborne transmission depends on a combination of viral factors (e.g. capacity to survive on surfaces), host factors (e.g. frequency of hand contact with the nose) and environmental factors (e.g. size of enclosure and density of shedders). Varying these and other parameters will change the relative contribution of the various transmission routes.9


...


Recognition of the limitations of studies that did not control for different modes of transmission led to further experiments being designed to isolate the airborne route as the sole explanation for transmission. In an often-cited study from the 1960s, Schulman and Kilbourne20 showed
that influenza could be transmitted between mice physically isolated by a double mesh-wire screen to maintain a 2 cm separation. The rate of infection in exposed mice was no different in this setting than when the exposed mice were housed in the same cage with the source mice.20

With a more complicated environmental design, Andrewes and Glover18 studied the transmission of an influenza A strain between ferrets. They showed that transmission occurred between source and exposed animals despite being housed in separate open-wiremeshed cages with the exposed animals placed 1 m higher and 1·6 m away from the source animals. They further showed that transmission occurred between source and exposed animals when they were separated by approximately 2·5 m long S-shaped and U-shaped closed ducts, with the direction of airflow from source towards exposed animals.18

Notes that aerosol may mean a number of things, depends on how exhaled, environment (airflow, humidity, etc.), whether aerosol-generating procedures performed, etc.

Notes that MERS showed aerosol transmission.

Emerging coronaviruses: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), middle-east respiratory syndrome (MERS) Coronaviruses are lipid-enveloped, single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses, belong to the genus Coronavirus and include several relatively benign, seasonal, common cold viruses (229E, OC43, NL63, HKU-1). They also include two new more virulent coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in the human population in 2003; and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which emerged in humans during 2012.
For SARS-CoV, several thorough epidemiological studies that include retrospective airflow tracer investigations are consistent with the hypothesis of an airborne transmission route [39–41]. Air-sampling studies have also demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV nucleic acid (RNA) in air, though they did not test viability using viral culture [42].
Although several studies compared and contrasted SARS and MERS from clinical and epidemiological angles [43–45], the predominant transmission mode was not discussed in detail, if at all. Several other studies do mention the potential for airborne transmission, when comparing potential routes of infection, but mainly in relation to super-spreading events or “aerosolizing procedures” such as broncho-alveolar lavage, and/or a potential route to take into consideration for precautionary infection control measures [46–48]. However, from the various published studies, for both MERS and SARS, it is arguable that a proportion of transmission occurs through the airborne route, although this may vary in different situations (e.g. depending on host, and environmental factors). The contribution from asymptomatic cases is also uncertain [49].
For both SARS and MERS, LRT samples offer the best diagnostic yield, often in the absence of any detectable virus in upper respiratory tract (URT) samples [50–52].
Furthermore, infected, symptomatic patients tend to develop severe LRT infections rather than URT disease.
Both of these aspects indicate that this is an airborne agent that has to penetrate directly into the LRT to preferentially replicate there before causing disease.
For MERS-CoV specifically, a recent study demonstrated the absence of expression of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the identified receptor used by the virus, in the cells of the human URT. The search for an alternate receptor was negative [53]. Thus, the human URT would seem little or non-permissive for MERS-CoV replication, indicating that successful infection can only result from the penetration into the LRT via direct inhalation of appropriately sized ‘droplet nuclei’-like’ particles. This makes any MERS-CoV transmission leading to MERS disease conditional on the presence of virus-containing droplets small enough to be inhaled into the LRT where the virus can replicate.

Recent literature investigating human expired aerosol indicates that a significant fraction of human expired aerosol is less than 10 μm in diameter across all types of activity (e.g. breathing, talking, and coughing; 18) and that upper respiratory illness increases production of aerosol particles (less than 10 μm; 19). Taken together these results suggest that virus expelled from infected individuals, including from those who are only mildly ill, may be transported by aerosol processes in their local 40 environment, potentially even in the absence of cough or aerosol generating procedures. Further, a recent study of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol and deposited on surfaces, indicates infectious aerosol may persist for several hours and on surfaces for as long as 2 days (20).

The WHO 5‐μm size threshold used to differentiate droplet from airborne transmission is an over‐simplification of the multifactorial mechanisms governing aerosol dispersal and deposition 7. It is not clear if 5 μm refers to the diameter obtained experimentally (which varies with measurement method and environmental conditions), or at which stage in the dynamic airborne journey. There is heterogeneity between individual subjects and between experimental methodologies with regard to particle size and number measured during expiration. Due to irregular particle geometric shape, ‘aerodynamic diameter’ is the preferred term which assigns a diameter as if the particle were a perfect sphere. The median aerodynamic diameter and the geometric standard deviation are more predictive of particle deposition than ‘simple’ diameter 20

Abstract
We provide research findings on the physics of aerosol and droplet dispersion relevant to the hypothesized aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the current pandemic. We utilize physics-based modeling at different levels of complexity, along with previous literature on coronaviruses, to investigate the possibility of airborne transmission. The previous literature, our 0D-3D simulations by various physics-based models, and theoretical calculations, indicate that the typical size range of speech and cough originated droplets () allows lingering in the air for ) so that they could be inhaled. Consistent with the previous literature, numerical evidence on the rapid drying process of even large droplets, up to sizes , into droplet nuclei/aerosols is provided. Based on the literature and the public media sources, we provide evidence that the individuals, who have been tested positive on COVID-19, could have been exposed to aerosols/droplet nuclei by inhaling them in significant numbers e.g. . By 3D scale-resolving computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, we give various examples on the transport and dilution of aerosols () over distances  in generic environments. We study susceptible and infected individuals in generic public places by Monte-Carlo modelling. The developed model takes into account the locally varying aerosol concentration levels which the susceptible accumulate via inhalation. The introduced concept, ’exposure time’ to virus containing aerosols is proposed to complement the traditional ’safety distance’ thinking. We show that the exposure time to inhale  aerosols could range from  to  or even to  depending on the situation. The Monte-Carlo simulations, along with the theory, provide clear quantitative insight to the exposure time in different public indoor environments.

Michael Riediker
In the case of nanodispersions, we need to understand the processes leading to aerosolization and how big the resulting droplets will be, as this is decisive for the fate of the droplets. Humans that have respiratory symptoms typically "spray" (a directional high-speed release process) large droplets of "nanodispersions" (the liquid present in the nose and upper airways) also known as sneezing and coughing. In addition, humans always, whether sick or not, release a cloud of much smaller aerosols during breathing, speaking, talking, singing, chanting loudly or coughing (in increasing order) (Johnson and Morawska 2009; Asadi et al. 2019), which corresponds to a fogging process. This "personal cloud" consist of micro-droplets of lung lining liquid that becomes airborne when the terminal bronchioles re-open during inhalation (Johnson and Morawska 2009). In both processes, the nanoparticles dispersed in the lining fluid are included in the droplets, which is known from studies of nanoparticle exposed individuals (Sauvain et al. 2014). The nanoparticle source strength (how much is released per time unit) corresponds to the cumulative volume of liquid that got airborne.

- high viral load

Protection against spray exposure by keeping distance or by using face shields seems effective for situations where the time spent in the joint airspace is short and where the room is large and well ventilated. This may explain why there are no reports about excessive infection numbers of supermarket cashiers. The airborne route becomes important when being for a prolonged time in the same room as a virus carrier, especially if that person is singing, shouting or physically active, as seen during superspreading events in choirs (Hamner et al. 2020) and fitness centers (Jang, Han, and Rhee 2020) and having a high viral load in the lining liquid (Riediker and Tsai 2020). In contrast, passing on the street through the "personal cloud" of an individual virus carrier will be a very low risk, as evidenced also by the landfall of the Princess Diamond in Taiwan where 627,386 persons had been in proximity of any of the 3000 embarked passengers, but nobody got sick as a result of the landfall (Chen et al. 2020). As soon as people have to spend prolonged time together, wearing face masks becomes important.
Masks can be used as emission control devices (surgical masks) and to protect the carrier (respirators).
Wide spread use of simple face coverings and surgical masks aimed to control emissions were found to be very effective at reducing community transmissions, while respirators along with splash guards were effective to protect medical staff in high risk situations (Chu et al. 2020).

Once a microdroplet has become airborne, it will disperse in the air. How many of the droplets remain airborne depends not just on their size but also on the turbulence and speed of air. In calm air, the larger droplets - those carrying the biggest load of viruses - will sediment more rapidly than in fast turbulent air. Also, if the aerosol is released into dry air, the droplets will shrink in size and be more likely to remain airborne. Initially, a shrinking size will only result in an increase of the virus concentration in the droplet, though complete drying may passivate the virus (Vejerano and Marr 2018). 
[note, Vejerano did not say it would passivate the virus]

Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2, as well as other coronaviruses, can be dispersed and potentially
transmitted by aerosols directly or via ventilation systems. We therefore investigated ventilation
openings in one COVID-19 ward and central ducts that expel indoor air from three COVID-19 wards
at Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden, during April and May 2020. Swab samples were taken from
individual ceiling ventilation openings and surfaces in central ducts. Samples were subsequently
subjected to rRT-PCR targeting the N and E genes of SARS-CoV-2. Central ventilation HEPA flters,
located several stories above the wards, were removed and portions analyzed in the same manner.
In two subsequent samplings, SARS-CoV-2 N and E genes were detected in seven and four out of 19
room vents, respectively. Central ventilation HEPA exhaust flters from the ward were found positive
for both genes in three samples. Corresponding flters from two other, adjacent COVID-19 wards
were also found positive. Infective ability of the samples was assessed by inoculation of susceptible
cell cultures but could not be determined in these experiments. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in central
ventilation systems, distant from patient areas, indicate that virus can be transported long distances
and that droplet transmission alone cannot reasonably explain this, especially considering the
relatively low air change rates in these wards. Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 must be taken
into consideration for preventive measures.

ABSTRACT
The spread of COVID19 through droplets ejected by infected individuals during sneezing and coughing has been considered a matter of key concern. Therefore, a quantitative understanding of the propagation of droplets containing the virus assumes immense importance. Here, we investigate the evolution of droplets in space and time under varying external conditions of temperature, humidity, and wind flow by using laws of statistical and fluid mechanics. The effects of drag, diffusion, and gravity on droplets of different sizes and ejection velocities have been considered during their motion in air. In still air, we found that bigger droplets traverse a larger distance, but smaller droplets remain suspended in air for a longer time. Therefore, in still air, the horizontal distance that a healthy individual should maintain from an infected one is based on the bigger droplets, but the time interval to be maintained is based on the smaller droplets. We show that in places with wind flow, the lighter droplets travel a larger distance and remain suspended in air for a longer time. Therefore, we conclude that both temporal and geometric distance that a healthy individual should maintain from an infected one is based on the smaller droplets under flowing air, which makes the use of a mask mandatory to prevent the virus. Maintenance of only stationary separation between healthy and infected individuals is not substantiated. The quantitative results obtained here will be useful to devise strategies for preventing the spread of other types of droplets containing microorganisms

Abstract
Cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in more than 200 countries. Thousands of health workers have been infected, and outbreaks have occurred in hospitals, aged care facilities, and prisons. The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines for contact and droplet precautions for healthcare workers caring for suspected COVID-19 patients, whereas the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has initially recommended airborne precautions. The 1- to 2-meter (≈3–6 feet) rule of spatial separation is central to droplet precautions and assumes that large droplets do not travel further than 2 meters (≈6 feet). We aimed to review the evidence for horizontal distance traveled by droplets and the guidelines issued by the WHO, CDC, and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control on respiratory protection for COVID-19. We found that the evidence base for current guidelines is sparse, and the available data do not support the 1- to 2-meter (≈3–6 feet) rule of spatial separation. Of 10 studies on horizontal droplet distance, 8 showed droplets travel more than 2 meters (≈6 feet), in some cases up to 8 meters (≈26 feet). Several studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) support aerosol transmission, and 1 study documented virus at a distance of 4 meters (≈13 feet) from the patient. Moreover, evidence suggests that infections cannot neatly be separated into the dichotomy of droplet versus airborne transmission routes. Available studies also show that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the air, and remain viable 3 hours after aerosolization. The weight of combined evidence supports airborne precautions for the occupational health and safety of health workers treating patients with COVID-19.

Abstract
Objective To study the airflow, transmission and clearance of aerosols in the clinical spaces of a hospital ward that had been used to care for patients with COVID-19, and to examine the impact of portable air cleaners on aerosol clearance. Design Observational study Setting A single ward of a tertiary public hospital in Melbourne Australia Intervention Glycerine-based aerosol was used as a surrogate for respiratory aerosols. The transmission of aerosols from a single patient room into corridors and a nurses station in the ward was measured. The rate of clearance of aerosols was measured over time from the patient room, nurses station and ward corridors with and without air cleaners (also called portable HEPA filters). Results Aerosols rapidly travelled from the single patient room into other parts of the ward. Air cleaners were effective in increasing the clearance of aerosols from the air in clinical spaces and reducing their spread to other areas. Conclusion Air cleaners may be useful in clinical spaces to help reduce the risk of healthcare acquired acquisition of respiratory viruses that are transmitted via aerosols.
